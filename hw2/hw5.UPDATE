Need to look at using procSelfMaps twice.  Is it needed?  Does it produce the correct output the second time.

Add information on debugging fldenv(%rcx).
  Check memory segment of $rcx and see if memory segment exists and has
the correct permissions.  Check (gdb) print/x context in restart and compare
with (gdb) print/x context during launch.  Maybe ask to print it in readckpt???
